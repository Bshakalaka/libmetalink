For unit tests, libcunit is required, so install its development package.
You need autoconf, automake and libtool for generating Makefiles.

Build
-----

in building library.

Then run "./configure". Run "./configure --help" for configuration options.

Then run "make" to build metalink.

To build and run unit tests, run "make check".
